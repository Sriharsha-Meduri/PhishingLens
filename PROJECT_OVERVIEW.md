# 🔍 PhishingLens - Multi-Modal Phishing Detection System — Project Overview

> **Verified status (please read first).** This document is the original hackathon
> vision and overstates several capabilities. The honest, verified state of the code is:
> - **Working end to end:** a fine-tuned DistilBERT text/email/SMS classifier and an
>   interpretable lexical URL engine, behind the consolidated `serve/app.py` API, with
>   a matching React web app and Chrome extension. Measured accuracy is **~0.90 macro-F1
>   on CEAS-08 email** (not "99.6%"), with temperature calibration and ~25 ms/msg on GPU.
> - **Aspirational / not validated:** the "4-source weighted 2-of-4 fusion" is in practice
>   a fixed rule dominated by the lexical scanner; the "GNN" is heuristic DNS/SSL/networkx
>   code (the shipped `gnn_model.onnx` is never loaded); "YOLO brand detection" uses a
>   generic COCO detector and does not recognise brands; and the "continuous-learning /
>   drift-detection" script is not functional as shipped. See `IMPROVEMENTS.md` for the
>   full, honest backlog. Treat claims below as the roadmap, not the current measured system.

## 🔄 Continuous Learning Pipeline

### Automated Retraining
- Scheduled model updates with new threat intelligence
- Data sources: PhishTank, OTX, MISP feeds
- Performance monitoring and drift detection

### Model Versioning
- A/B testing framework for new models
- Gradual rollout with performance monitoring
- Automatic rollback on performance degradation

### Feedback Integration
- User feedback collection and analysis
- False positive/negative tracking
- Continuous improvement based on real-world data
- Automated deployment with zero-downtime updates
- Model backup and rollback capabilities
  - `hf_eval_scores.csv` (per‑row scores)
  - `threshold_sweep_hf.csv` (metrics across thresholds 0.05–0.20)
  - `threshold_selection_hf.json` (chosen t* with metrics)
  - `model_manifest_hf.json` (latency, device, params, memory)

#### CEAS08 Evaluation (large‑scale)
- Dataset path: `data/holdout/ceas08.csv` with columns `body` (text), `label` (1=phish,0=safe).
- Commands:
```bash
# GPU
python scripts/eval_hf_text.py --holdout data/holdout/ceas08.csv --text_col body --label_col label --device cuda --batch_size 128
# CPU (slower)
python scripts/eval_hf_text.py --holdout data/holdout/ceas08.csv --text_col body --label_col label --device cpu --batch_size 32
```
- Example CEAS08 results (most recent): T≈3.000, t*≈0.125, macro‑F1≈0.896, precision≈0.918, recall≈0.889, accuracy≈0.900.
- Error analysis utilities produce:
  - `hf_confusion_ceas.json` (confusion matrix, per‑class metrics)
  - `hf_errors_ceas_top50.csv` (top‑50 false positives/negatives)

### 9) Thresholding Strategy
- Use calibrated probability (`phishing_prob_cal`).
- For staging/production, set `EXTERNAL_TEXT_THRESHOLD` via environment.
- For interactive demos with short text, you may increase the threshold to reduce false positives.
- Always choose thresholds informed by `threshold_sweep_hf.csv` and operational precision/recall targets.

- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus + Grafana integration with comprehensive metrics collection and alerting
- **Enhanced Features**: All advanced features enabled (brand detection, visual checks, URL fusion, continuous learning)

### 13) Rollback and Safety
- Keep `SERVICE_FALLBACK_MODEL_ID` pointed to a known‑good local model.
- Text service supports `--use_fallback` path for quick rollback.
- Thresholds can be adjusted without code changes (environment only).

### 14) Security Considerations
- Input validation in services; CORS configured in gateway.
- Safe handling of user text/URLs; avoid storing sensitive payloads.
- Integrations for IOC/threat feeds (OTX, PhishTank, MISP) available.

### 15) Troubleshooting Guide (Quick)
- Model always “safe” or always “phish”: check active model id, confirm calibrated thresholding is enabled (`SERVICE_USE_EXTERNAL_THRESHOLD=true`), tune `EXTERNAL_TEXT_THRESHOLD`.
- Slow inference: verify device selection and batch size; on GPU ensure CUDA build of PyTorch.
- Docker ports busy: change mappings in compose files.
- Dataset schema errors: use `--text_col`/`--label_col` flags.

### 16) CI/CD and Quality
- GitHub Actions friendly; unit/integration testing recommended.
- Linting/typing via standard Python toolchain.
